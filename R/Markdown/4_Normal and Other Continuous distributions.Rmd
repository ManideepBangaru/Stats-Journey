Continuous probability distributions vary by the shape under the curve.

### Normal Distribution
The normal distribution is not only symmetrical, but bell-shaped, a shape that (loosely) suggests the profile of a bell. Being bell-shaped means that most values of the continuous vari- able will cluster around the mean.

### Uniform Distribution
It is also known as rectangular distribution, contains the values that are equally distributed in the range between the minimum value and the maximum value.
In a uniform distribution every value has a equal chance of occurrence
